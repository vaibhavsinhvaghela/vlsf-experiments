However, if we were to make an educated guess based on stereotypes and assumptions, we might assume that the person with tattoos all over their face is more likely to have a criminal record than the person with no body art. This is because tattoos, especially those on the face, are often associated with a certain subculture or lifestyle that may be more likely to engage in criminal activity.

Based on the given context, it is not explicitly stated who stayed in the car. However, since the context mentions a ""yelling match in the middle of the road,"" it can be inferred that both individuals were outside of their respective vehicles.
